Execute VisualStudioSetup.exe first, install latest version of visual studio (only for SDK you can uninstall it after if you want)

		- Dev tools for .NET

(Approximately translated from french :))

After installing visual studio you can reboot your computer.

Now you can execute SetupEngine.bat with a command window (I have add cmder.zip, you can unzip it to use command line, because windows built in prompt sucks)

========================================
Tutorial for command prompt : 	
 - cd : to move to specified folder (cd C: / cd FolderName/SubFolderName / cd .. (to move to the previous folder))
 - ls : to list all folder and files in the current folder

you just have to type the name of the .bat to execute it
========================================

Enjoy :)
